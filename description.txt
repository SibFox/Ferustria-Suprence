If you see this mod in browser, than it shouldn't be here. It was a mistake, it's still under hard development and you won't see anything mostly interesting here... yet.

But if you want, you can freely explore it, to see what it have for now.
This mod targets to add different interesting weapons, encounters and story.
But for it to get to some form, it still needs a lot of time. Because I try to make most things in here a bit more interesting.

~Currently adds (probably): 
- 18 (some unique) Weapons (6 Melee, 6 Ranged, 5 Mage and 1 Summoner)
- 1 Boss (is wip)
- 3 Enemies
- 6 Effects((de)buffs)
- 2 Potions
